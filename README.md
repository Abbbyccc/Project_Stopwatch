## Project_Stopwatch
### For this task you will create a HTML page with a functional stopwatch. The stopwatch must have the following features:

[Live](https://abbbyccc.github.io/Project_Stopwatch/)

ðŸ“Œ Time display: The current elapsed time in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds)<br>
ðŸ“Œ Start button: A button to start or continue a timer.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Pause button: A button to pause the running timer.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Reset button: A button to reset the timer to zero.<br>

### Bonus points:
ðŸ“Œ Lap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Clear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history<br>
ðŸ“Œ Make it look good<br>
ðŸ“Œ No bugs or quirky behaviour... (is keeping good time?)<br>
ðŸ“Œ Any build tools, instructions or other things you think a good project should include<br>

### We are looking for the following
ðŸ“Œ We will only be testing this in Chrome.<br>
ðŸ“Œ These are intended to give us a feel for how you work as a developer and your level of experience and technical ability.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Approach is more important than framework. By all means use your tool of choice but we won't judge<br>
